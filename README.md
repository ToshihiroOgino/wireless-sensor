# Wireless Sensor with TinyGo

## Editor Settings

If you want to configure manually your editor for TinyGo development, please refer to the [official documentation](https://tinygo.org/docs/guides/ide-integration/vscode/)

Or just use the vscode extension [tinygo.vscode-tinygo](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tinygo.vscode-tinygo) which will set up everything for you.
